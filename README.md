Welcome to Bamazon, the (not-so) future of shopping. This is an assignment for the KU Coding Bootcamp

Bamazon is a simple CLI based app that utilizes Node.js to manipulate a MySQL database. This deployment has two apps: one for customers, the other for managers. Both utilize the mysql, inquirer, and cli-table Node packages. 

The Customer app is simple: it prints a table to the console and allows the customer to select a product by id, as well as the amount they wish to purchase.

The manager app has more functionality: it allows the manager to view the Bamazon inventory, view which items Bamazon is low on, order products to be restocked, or add new products to the Bamazon inventory. 

Demo videos for both apps are available.
